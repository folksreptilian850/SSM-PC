# Shared Spatial Memory Through Predictive Coding

This repository provides the **official open-source implementation** of  
**“Shared Spatial Memory Through Predictive Coding” (Fang et al., 2025)**.  
The framework unifies **grid-cell-like spatial coding**, **predictive BEV reconstruction**,  
and **communication-efficient shared spatial memory** under a single predictive-coding objective.

## Paper Overview

Sharing and reconstructing a coherent map is notoriously challenging in partially observed, bandwidth-limited environments.  
The associated paper reframes cooperation as **minimizing mutual predictive uncertainty**:  
agents communicate only the bits that most reduce their partners' prediction error.

**Core ingredients:**
- A **grid-cell-like metric scaffold** emerging from self-supervised motion forecasting, supporting accurate self-localization.  
- **Social place-cell (SPC)** populations that encode teammates’ trajectories, enabling agents to infer partner locations.  
- A **hierarchical RL policy (HRL-ICM)** that decides *when* to communicate, guided by an information-bottleneck objective.

On the Memory-Maze benchmark, this predictive-coding strategy maintains robustness even when link budget drops from  
128 → 4 bits per step (success rate 73.5% → 64.4%), while a full-broadcast baseline collapses from 67.6% → 28.6%.

## 2. Predictive BEV Reconstruction

Located in `bev_generation/`, this module learns to reconstruct a **bird’s-eye-view (BEV)** map from egocentric RGB frames
via a Transformer-based visual predictive model.

### Key Scripts

| Purpose                                  | Command                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Train BEV predictor                      | `python train.py`                                                          |
| Multi-GPU training                       | `python train_multi_gpu.py --config <cfg_json>`                            |
| Train target detector                    | `python train_target_detector.py`                                          |
| Inference & video output                 | `python visualization_output.py --bev_model <ckpt> --target_model <ckpt>`  |
| Spatial Memory Reconstruction (was SLAM) | `python run_visualization.py --dataset_path <seq> --model_path <bev_ckpt>` |

This module supports environment variables (`BEV_MODEL_PATH`, `BEV_DATASET_PATH`, etc.) for flexible configuration.

#### Requirements

```bash
pip install -r bev_generation/requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation

### Grid-Cell Module

* Default: `grid_cell/data/self-navigation-maze-frame-only/`
* Override via `GRID_DATA_ROOT`

### BEV Module

* Default: `bev_generation/data/`
* Override via `BEV_DATA_ROOT`

Each dataset directory should contain JSON metadata (`frame_info.json`, `env_config.json`)
and image assets compatible with the dataset loaders.

## Reproducing Paper Results

1. Prepare datasets as above.
2. Train the grid-cell module or use provided checkpoints.
3. Run gridness analyses and reproduce training videos (Video 5, trajectory comparison).
4. Train or reuse BEV predictor weights, then visualize spatial memory reconstruction results.
